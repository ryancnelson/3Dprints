Hi, welcome to my misc github repo of 3d-printable things:

recent notes:  (updated 3/13/2014)
the "spud" disk bracket for Sun Microsystems seems to *fit* well, but the current placement of holes is definitely 
incorrect.  REPEAT: the holes aren't in the right place.  All other dimensions appear to match the bracket I took
measurements from.

I'll re-measure and tweak that, soon, and will probably replace the holes with slots, to allow for some slop.

I printed this vertically, with the "plate" on the printbed, and the two "arms" pointing straight up.  I've added
supports here to prevent mild warping as the plastic cools, but it's really actually not a problem when printing 
with PLA.  The supports also make each layer take a little longer, which helps with cooling times for such a slender
part.

This is about the tallest part my Makerbot Rep 1 can print, but it prints very well, and in about 2 hours.

I sliced it with Simplify3d, and added a little z-axis jump during retraction so my 2nd nozzle never hits the arms
during movement.
